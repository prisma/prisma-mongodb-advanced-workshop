# Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete the tasks in the workshop, you should have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine *or* a hosted MongoDB instance (e.g. on Atlas)
- A code editor installed *(preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))*.
- A basic understanding of schemaless database concepts.

# What you'll do

In this workshop, you‚Äôll dive into a full-stack application that is *half-built*. The entire application is visually complete and functional, however it is using all static data. Your job will be to hook the site up to a MongoDB database and replace all of the static data with live data from that database.

You'll start by setting up Prisma with a MongoDB database, modeling out some of your required data, and learning about how a *‚Äúschema‚Äù* fits into the world of *schemaless* databases (*lesson 1).*

Then, you'll use Prisma Client to build all of the queries relating to a user‚Äôs data. You will write some simple queries, some more complex ones, and take a look at how to handle *embedded documents* (*lesson 2*).

Next, you‚Äôll update your Prisma schema to account for the next set of data: kudos. You‚Äôll learn how to set up relations, how to implement referential actions, and how Prisma can solve a few of the *gotchas* that come with a schemaless database (*lesson 3*).

Finally, you‚Äôll wrap up the application‚Äôs loose ends by building all of the queries that read and write Kudos data (*lesson 4*).

[Build queries for user data](build-queries.md)

[Update your schema](update-schema.md)

[Add queries for kudos data](add-kudos.md)

# What does a lesson look like?

A *lesson* is structured in two parts:

1. **Host walkthrough:** At the beginning of each *lesson*, your host will walk you through the different *tasks* you'll encounter in this lesson. Please *be attentive* during that time and follow the host's explanations to be sure that you can accomplish the tasks yourself when you're working on them later. **Do not code along or work on the tasks yourself yet!** Instead, you can think of questions or raise anything that you don't understand (e.g. in the **Q & A** section of Zoom).
2. **Do it yourself:** Once the host is done showing and explaining the different tasks, you get dedicated time to work on the tasks yourself!

# Want to host this workshop yourself?
